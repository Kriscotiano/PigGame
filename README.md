## Game Rules
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their **ROUND** score.
- If the player rolls a 1, all of their **ROUND** score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that their **ROUND** score gets added to their **GLOBAL** score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach 100 points on **GLOBAL** score wins the game!
